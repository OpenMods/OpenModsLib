OpenModsLib
===========

OpenModsLib is a work-in-progress library of all our common code from OpenBlocks and OpenPeripheral. It's purpose is to provide a common API for both the OpenMods Team to use for future mods, speeding up development and reducing redundent code, and also for others to use for their mods. Cutting out some of the hard work and leaving more time to write the important content.
